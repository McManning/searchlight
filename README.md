# Searchlight

[Searchkit](https://www.searchkit.co/) compatible GraphQL API extensions for applications built with [Lighthouse PHP](https://lighthouse-php.com/).

>This project is still an early draft and not production ready.

## Project Goals

- PHP 7.4+ support
- ElasticSearch 7+ and OpenSearch 2+ support
- 100% Searchkit compatible GraphQL API
- Serverside configuration in a sort of "if you've used Searchkit with Apollo this should feel familiar" way.
- Set of directives to help drive search configuration per provider
- Maybe a tie-in/compatibility layer for Laravel Scout (sans faceting, most likely)
- Maybe some integrations with Lighthouse access control features (i.e. restricting ES document access through access-driven filters)
